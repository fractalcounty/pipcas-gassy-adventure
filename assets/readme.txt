pipca idle - loop the blinking usually, occassionally have her burp (starts at frame #5)
		hold frame #5 longer than the rest of the frames

pipca jump - hold frame #3 until the apex of the jump, then start looping the falling anim which is #frame 3 - frame #5 on repeat
             when holding fart button midair, loop frames #1 and #2. when button released, pipca lets out a fart and then gets boosted in the air, then have it follow same anim logic as jump/fall

pipca walk - have anim speed match in-game speed at a variable rate
